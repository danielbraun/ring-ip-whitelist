# Ring-IP-Whitelist

Ring middleware that allows you to protect routes with an IP whitelist.

## Install

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj`

```
[net.danielcompton/ring-ip-whitelist "0.1.0"]
```

## Usage

To IP whitelist routes, wrap them with `wrap-ip-whitelist`.

```clj
(ns my.cool-ns
  (:require [ring.middleware.ip-whitelist :as ip]))

(def app
  (-> handler
      (ip/wrap-ip-whitelist {:cidrs ["8.8.4.4" "210.50.2.0/30" "::1/128"})))
```

`wrap-ip-whitelist` takes a map of configuration options

* `:cidrs`: a whitelist of CIDR strings or IP addresses. IP addresses are treated as a CIDR for a single address (e.g. a /32 for an IPv4 address). If the list is inside an atom then the whitelist will be updated when the atom changes.
* `:ip-fn`: function to extract the IP address. Defaults to `:remote-addr`.
* `:error-response`: Response to return if request is not authorised. Defaults to a 403 Not Authorized response.
* `:allow-access?`: An additional function that can be provided if IP whitelisting fails but more checking is needed before denying access. Takes a request argument, returns true if the request should be allowed, else false."

CIDR ranges shouldn't be too large. The current implementation generates every IP address in the CIDR range. This is fine for a smallish number of IP addresses in the whitelist, and keeps the implementation simple and fast. The tradeoff is memory space. Don't use this to whitelist the whole world unless you want to run out of memory very shortly afterwards.

#### Passing `:cidrs` as an atom

```clj
(def ip-whitelist (atom {"8.8.4.4"})
(-> routes
    (ip/wrap-ip-whitelist {:cidrs ip-whitelist}))

(swap! ip-whitelist conj "100.121.5.33/30")
```

#### ``:ip-fn`

look at X-Forwarded-For headers

#### `:error-response`

You may want to return either a customised 403 error page that matches your sites theme, or a 404 so you don't reveal that the user wasn't authorised to access a protected route. Either way, you can pass an error-response function to override the default.

```clj
(-> routes
    (ip/wrap-ip-whitelist {:cidrs ["127.0.0.1"]
                           :error-response {:status 404
                                            :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
                                            :body "<h1>Not found</h1>"}}))
```

#### `:allow-access?`

Say you want to allow access from within your internal network to anyone, but outside users must be authenticated.

```clj
(-> routes
    (ip/wrap-ip-whitelist {:cidrs ["10.0.0.0/28"]
                           :allow-access (fn [req] (check-cookies-to-see-if-authorised req))}))
```


## Security of IP whitelisting

While IP whitelisting increases the difficulty for an attacker, if an attacker controls a router between you and the server they can bypass your IP whitelisting. Also, if they can get onto the network of one of the whitelisted ranges then it is also game over. Treat IP whitelisting as an additional layer of security, not your only one.
